## Answer the following questions

### 1. What is JSX, and why is it used?

#### Answer:

JSX is a syntax extension for Javascript and its full meaning is `Javascript XML`. It is a syntactic sugar where we, the developer, can write html look like tags but behind the scene they are not actual html tags rather they are converted to Javascript function (`React.createElement()`). It makes UI structure more intuitive and readable. Though it is created by react but as it is a syntactic sugar, other library or framework could create their own JSX. That means, we can use JSX outside react. Also as it a syntactic sugar, browser doesn't understand JSX. It need Babel compiler to transfer it into Javascript.

### 2. What is the difference between State and Props?

#### Answer:

| State                                                                       | Props                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| State is an internal data of a component.                                   | Props is an external data of a component.                                                                                              |
| State is like memory of a component cause it is persistent between renders. | Props is like function parameters which value is coming from parent component.                                                         |
| Component can update state.                                                 | Props is read only. Component shouldn't update props.                                                                                  |
| Updating state causes component to re-render.                               | Parent component re-render causes props change(only for object type props). So receiving new props also causes component to re-render. |

### 3.What is the useState hook, and how does it work?

#### Answer:

It is the fundamental hook to create state in the functional component. Before hooks, only class components could have state but `usestate()` changed that and make functional components much more powerful.

`useState()` hook return two things. One is current state value and second is a function to update the state value.

`const [count, setCount] = useState(0);`

Here -

- `useState(0)` defines state with initial value `0` and this initial value only apply in initial component render. Initial value can be a string, number, boolean, array, object or function.
- `count` is the current state value.
- `setCount` is the function which is used to update state value.

### 4. How can you share state between components in React?

#### Answer:

We can share state between components in react as props. If siblings component need state, we can lifting the state up and place the state into a common parent component of the siblings component and pass the state as props.

```js
function Parent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <>
      <ChildA count={count} />
      <ChildB setCount={setCount} />
    </>
  );
}
```

We can also use local storage, context api, custom hooks and state management libraries to share state between components.

### 5. How is event handling done in React?

#### Answer:

To handle events, React wraps native browser events so that all browser have consistent behavior of same events. This event wrapper called SyntheticEvent.

SyntheticEvent support most DOM events like `onClick`, `onMouseEnter` etc. and uses camelcase for event handler. We can also use `event.preventDefault()` and `event.stopPropagation()` just like Javascript.

```js
<button onClick={() => handleClick("Hello")}>Click</button>
```

Behind the scene, it uses event delegation by attaching event listener to the root of the DOM tree which improves performance.
